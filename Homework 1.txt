Summary: I got one Loaded Coin question legitimately wrong. I said it was continuous because I got caught up thinking about the continuous nature of the probability distribution you were trying to expose.  In retrospect, that is way overthinking it. Loaded Coin is not continuous. The other two are more upsetting. One was a simple counting error.  I thought I double checked all the problems, but I might have missed this one. The final mistake occured because I failed to read or understand one of the clarifications. I didn't realize the connections between the graph nodes were ordered downward and so i thought in the algorithm's pursuit of depth it would continue to explore nodes even if they were drawn "above" themselves.  Again, I made it harder than it was supposed to be.

Next: Read all clarifications. Are you making something harded than it is meant to be? Double check all questions! Think simply.
